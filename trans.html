	<p>In summary this is what the woman is saying; "Dawu(lion) how are you khulu(ancestor), my mother said I should greet you. The Sibanda clan also said I should greet you and pay their respects. I saw them in Bulawayo (beautiful city in Zimbabwe), they sent me to you, even those in America said I should come and see you and greet you, those of the Dawu ancestors."</p>
	<p>If she says Dawu, she is not referring to the lion as such, but her ancestors who live inside the lion. All the dead ancestors, she believes she can connect to them via the lion.</p>
