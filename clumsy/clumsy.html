	<h1 align="center">Clumsy heart💔</h1>
<pre align="center"><strong>   

Countless times have you fallen,

And with each fall yields

A series of indefinite tripping;

A loop, a rerun

Of boring scenes so familiar

And exchanges so sickening.

Yet,

With faith of child,

You leap into uncatching arms

Only to be blown yards into 

Piercing thorns of rejection.

<span id="more-4"></span>          
                
While you lie soaked in blood 

From heavily perforated heart

You begin to question 

Your endurance of such now 

Commonplace and agonizing thoughts

Of pleasures you cannot share and hold,

You heal and stand

Only,

To fall again

And these are,

The pains you suffer,

With possession of clumsy heart🙏🏽
