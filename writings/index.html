<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>If you actually visualize this with a critical eye, it is surprisingly stunning how
commonplace lies have become. For example, without remorse, I can easily lie to my
friend that I forgot her pencil in my room when I know I lost it but I’m optimistic that I
will get a similar replacement. If I look at a surface level, the lie sounds quite justified as
she will get a similar pencil without hardly noticing any difference. Yet at their uttermost,
lies can bring insurmountable torment that has seen the crumble of communities which
were believed to be closely knit. In her book Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private
Life, Sissela Bok raises an awareness of the consequences lies can bring. She believes
that for trust and integrity are essential in forming good relations among people. For the
trust to exist, she argues that it has to be based on truth telling. If my friend were to
discover that I can’t be open to her and base our friendship on truth, she will doubt my
actions in the future. Hence Bok believes that lies, no matter how harmless they may
seem, pose a great danger in fostering good relationships. She cites to Samuel Johnson’s
quote that, “even the devils themselves do not lie to each other, since the society of Hell
could not exist without truth any more than others (Page XX).” She uses this evidence to
support her basic claim that lies pose a great threat to stable relationships. To be more
effective and persuasive in her argument, she appeals to the reader’s emotions by using
strong and descriptive language. Although some critics may argue that she manipulates
the reader’s emotions, I believe it’s a necessary tool engage readers more critically with
the text since we underestimate the significance if lying. <a href="first_story.html/#more-20" class="more-link">Keep reading &rarr;</a></p>

<h2>Chapter I</h2>
<p>He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees. The mountainside sloped gently where he lay; but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass. There was a stream alongside the road and far down the pass he saw a mill beside the stream and the falling water of the dam, white in the summer sunlight.</p>
<p>“Is that the mill?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I do not remember it.”</p>
<p>“It was built since you were here. The old mill is farther down; much below the pass.”</p>
<p>He spread the photostated military map out on the forest floor and looked at it carefully. The old man looked over his shoulder. He was a short and solid old man in a black peasant&#8217;s smock and gray iron-stiff trousers and he wore rope-soled shoes. He was breathing heavily from the climb and his hand rested on one of the two heavy packs they had been carrying.</p>
<p>“Then you cannot see the bridge from here.”</p>
<p>“No,” the old man said. “This is the easy country of the pass where the stream flows gently. Below, where the road turns out of sight in the trees, it drops suddenly and there is a steep gorge &#8212; ” <a href="http://demo.onedesigns.com/graceunderpressure/literary/2015/07/16/for-whom-the-bell-tolls/#more-17" class="more-link">Keep reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.</p>
<p>The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its [9] reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.</p>
<p>Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.</p>
<p>“Santiago,” the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up. “I could go with you again. We’ve made some money.”</p>
<p>The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.</p>
<p>“No,” the old man said. “You’re with a lucky boat. Stay with them.”</p>
<p>“But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks.”</p>
<p>“I remember,” the old man said. “I know you did not leave me because you doubted.”</p>

<h2>Chapter I: A Good Café on the Place St-Michel</h2>
<p>Then there was the bad weather. It would come in one day when the fall was over. We would have to shut the windows in the night against the rain and the cold wind would strip the leaves from the trees in the Place Contrescarpe. The leaves lay sodden in the rain and the wind drove the rain against the big green autobus at the terminal and the Cafe des Amateurs was crowded and the windows misted over from the heat and the smoke inside.</p>
<p>It was a sad, evilly run cafe where the drunkards of the quarter crowded together and I kept away from it because of the smell of dirty bodies and the sour smell of drunkenness.</p>
<p>The men and women who frequented the Amateurs stayed drunk all of the time, or all of the time they could afford it, mostly on wine which they bought by the half-litre or litre.</p>
<p>Many strangely named aperitifs were advertised, but few people could afford them except as a foundation to build their wine drunks on. The women drunkards were called poivrottes, which meant female rummies.</p>
<p>The Cafe des Amateurs was the cesspool of the rue Mouffetard, that wonderful narrow crowded market street which led into the Place Contrescarpe. The squat toilets of the old apartment houses, one by the side of the stairs on each floor with the two cleated cement shoe-shaped elevations on each side of the aperture so a locataire would not slip, emptied into cesspools which were emptied by pumping into horse-drawn tank wagons at night. In the summer time, with all windows open, we would hear the pumping and the odour was very strong. The tank wagons were painted brown and saffron colour and in the moonlight when they worked the rue Cardinal Lemoine their wheeled, horse-drawn cylinders looked like Braque paintings. No one emptied the Cafe des Amateurs though, and its yellowed poster stating theterms and penalties of the law against public drunkenness was as flyblown and disregarded as its clients were constant and ill-smelling.</p>
<p>All of the sadness of the city came suddenly with the first cold rains of winter, and there were no more tops to the high white houses as you walked but only the wet blackness of the street and the closed doors of the small shops, the herb sellers, the stationery and the newspaper shops, the midwife &#8211; second class &#8211; and the hotel where Verlaine had died, where I had a room on the top floor where Iworked.</p>
<p>It was either six or eight flights up to the top floor and it was very cold and I knew how much it would cost for a bundle of small twigs, three wire-wrapped packets of short, half-pencil length pieces of split pine to catch fire from the twigs, and then the bundle of half-dried lengths of hard wood that I must buy to make a fire that would warm the room.</p>

<h2>Chapter I</h2>
<p>Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider Kelly&#8217;s star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn&#8217;s distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his class who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.</p>
<p>I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly. Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him.</p>
<p>Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious. No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton. He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter. He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter. As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock. <a href="http://demo.onedesigns.com/graceunderpressure/literary/2015/07/16/the-sun-also-rises/#more-8" class="more-link">Keep reading &rarr;</a></p>

<pre>INT. MELANIE'S BEDROOM
               
Melanie is lying very still on the bed. Her closed eyes are sunken in twin purple circles. Her face is a waxy yellow. Scarlett tiptoes across the room to the quiet figure and stands over her.

                          SCARLETT
               It's me, Melly.
               
The eyes open, then close again.

                          MELANIE
               Promise me?
                          
                          SCARLETT
               Anything!
                          
                          MELANIE
               Look after my little boy! I gave
               him to you once before, remember?
               The day he was born?
                          
                          SCARLETT
               Oh, Melly, don't talk this way! I
               know you'll get well!
                          
                          MELANIE
               Promise me... College? 
                          
                          SCARLETT
               Yes! Yes! And Europe, and a pony.
               Whatever he wants, but - Melly! do
               try...
                          
                          MELANIE
               Ashley...

Scarlett's eyes go wide but Melanie continues

                          MELANIE (CONT'D)
               Ashley and you...
                          
                          SCARLETT
                    (almost voiceless)
               What about - Ashley, Melly?
                          
                          MELANIE
               Look after him for me... just as
               you looked - looked after me for
               him.
                          
                          SCARLETT
               I will, Melly.
                          
                          MELANIE
               Look after him. But never let him
               know.
               
Scarlett is almost on the point of breaking. She rises, abruptly sinking her teeth into the thumb to regain control. The door opens slightly. <a href="poetry.html/#more-4" class="more-link">Keep reading &rarr;</a></pre>
