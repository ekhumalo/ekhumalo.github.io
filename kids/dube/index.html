<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>A guide for Nhlalo</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a simple guide to explore different areas that might be of interest to every young boy of your age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, first things first, I hope you have read the Harry Potter Books, the seven of them! Don't worry, the numbers can not scare you. Once you start one, you'll be consumed by this amazing force and and you won't be able to stop. Still on books, I've a few recommendations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Things Fall Apart - Chinua Achebe</p>
<ul>
<li>The story's main theme concerns pre- and post-colonial life in late nineteenth century Nigeria</li>
</ul>
<p>Animal Farm - George Orwell</p>
<ul>
<li>You'll love this one (Reserve it for last, jokes!). It's about animals but you'll learn a lot about socialism and human interactions</li>
</ul>
<p>Zoya - Danielle Steele</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow a young Princess who is stripped of wealth, lives in the hardest of all times. A bit long but worth it.</li>
</ul>
<p>And We'll stop here in the mean time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, do you know the amazing things which are being done with technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>Elon Musk presenting the solar house powered by solar roof. Watch video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCU0vG3Gpfs" target="_blank">here</a>. You know this guy is South African, guess what, he wants to colonize Mars!!!!. You can <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT0O-Fv8bSAhUJqVQKHX0eDlMQFggaMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FElon_Musk&amp;usg=AFQjCNHEG1SVnoxhbcyFXSpR8pLrQG_l2w&amp;sig2=DPydvF1HSiRDInWBQMLonw" target="_blank">read about him</a> on Wikipedia</li>
<li>Amazon, this super awesome retail company amazed me earlier this yearThey launched Amazon Go, a new kind of store featuring the world&rsquo;s most advanced shopping technology. No lines, no checkout &ndash; just grab and go. Watch the videoof this "Just Walk out technology" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrmMk1Myrxc">here</a>. I'm waiting to test it next year when they launch it in San Francisco</li>
<li>Okay, this is fun. another carzy technology! Uber and google's self driving car, They are around my city right now. I had a ride a month ago. But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzzQ42D9Srw" target="_blank">one of them crossed a red traffic light</a>, Of course it's expected, they are robots!!!!</li>
</ul>

<p>Wait, were you impressed, if so. You can also learn how to create your own. It's time to LEARN HOW TO CODE!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trust me, you're not to early. I wish I started coding when I was 5. This one is a joke though. I enjoyed playing with mud at that age. . You can aim to have your website at the end of this year, If you do, I'll pay for your hosting and get you a cool domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is an online course to take</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've said a lot it's good to leave more for the future. ooh before I forget, if you're thinking of any TV Show to Watch. Do consider Fringe or The Big Bang Theory or Flash or none at all, books first. jokes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the best my boy.&nbsp;</p>
