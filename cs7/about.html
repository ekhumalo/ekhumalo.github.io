      <h2 class="section">Course Description</h2>

<p>CS 7 is an introduction to computer science, with particular
emphasis on The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs from a programmer's point of view. This course concentrates mostly on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem.</p>

<p>In CS 7, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how
to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques
for controlling program complexity, such as functional programming, data
abstraction, and object-oriented programming. Mastery of a particular
programming language is a very useful side effect of studying these general
techniques. However, our hope is that once you have learned the essence of
programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a
few days' work.</p>

<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2 class="section">Programming Language</h2>

<p>CS7 uses the Python 3 programming language.  Python is a popular language in
both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of
exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language
developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of
its contributors. </p>

<p>Our choice in using this language is primarily motivated by the strength of Python's
programming community, which you will soon join as you learn the language.
Python also has excellent library support for a vast range of application areas.
Knowing Python will help you pursue your future programming interests, wherever
they may lead you.</p>

<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2 class="section">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Knowledge of Advanced Level Mathematics is a corequisite for CS7. (That is, it may be taken concurrently.)</p>

<p>There is no formal programming-related prerequisites for admission to CS7.
There is no need for you to be familiar with any particular programming
language. If you have some knowledge in any programming language and some Math, then
you are certainly ready for CS7.</p>


<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2 class="section">Course Materials</h2>

<p>There is no required textbook for this course. Our primary text will be a
series of lecture notes based on the classic book, <a
  href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and
  Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>. Lecture notes will be posted to the course website.  </p>

<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2 class="section">Optional Discussion Section</h2>

<p>In addition to the lectures on Monday and Tuesday the course
consists of one optional discussion section each week.




<p>You are expected to attend all class lectures.  We will track attendance and assign points for certification.

<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2 class="section">Ask Questions!</h2>

<p>Your first and most important resource for help in learning the material in
this course is your fellow students. Work closely with your project partner. You
are responsible for helping each other learn.

<p>If you have questions that others might have as well, regarding projects,
homeworks, course policies, etc., post your questions to <a
  href="http://www.piazza.com/class"> CS7 WhatsApp Group</a>, the course messaging
service.

<p>The instructor and other Teaching Assistants are available to answer questions. You may drop in during<a href="index.html#schedule"> office hours</a>, make
appointments for other times, or email us.

<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2 class="section">Projects and Homeworks</h2>

<p>Each week there will be problems assigned for you to work on, most of which will
involve writing and debugging programs. These assignments come in three categories:

<p>Laboratory exercises are short, relatively simple exercises
  designed to introduce a new topic.</p>

<p>Homework assignments are slightly more involved versions of lab
  exercises, meant to illustrate and explore new topics.  Homeworks are
  generally assigned on Fridays and due the following Friday at 5pm.  You are
  encouraged to discuss the homework with other students, but your final
  solution should be developed either alone or with one partner.</p>

<p>Projects are larger assignments intended to teach you how to
  combine ideas from the course in interesting ways. There are three very intense projects for the course.  You are encouraged to complete projects in
  pairs; your partner should be another sxsssstudent in the class.</p>

<p>The purpose of the homework is for you to learn the course material, not to prove that you already know it. Therefore, the weekly homeworks are not graded on the correctness of your solutions, but on effort. You will get full credit for an entirely wrong answer that shows reasonable effort! Homeworks will be graded automatically.

<p>Each homework is worth two points for a reasonable effort, zero points for a
missing homework or one that seems to show no effort, or negative ten (-10)
points for a solution copied from someone else.

<p>The three programming projects are graded on the correctness and clarity of your solutions.  If you work with a partner (which you should), work together to ensure that both group members understand the complete program you create.

<p>Projects and homeworks will be submitted online. You'll need to contact the Instructor if you're doing so offline.

<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2 class="section">Learning Cooperatively</h2>

<p>We encourage you to discuss <i>all</i>
of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on
them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than
if you do not.  Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.


<p>Since you're working collaboratively, keep your project partner and the Instructor informed.  If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course
for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason,
please don't just disappear silently!  You should inform your project partner
and the Instructor, so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can't
finish.

<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2 class="section">Late Policy</h2>

<p>If you cannot turn in an assignment on time, contact the Instructor and partner as early as possible. Late project submission requires approval by the Instructor. No credit will be given for late homework, or for projects turned in more than one day late. Exceptions
may be made for <em>extraordinary</em> circumstances.

<a name="announcements"></a>
<h2 class="section">A Parting Thought</h2>

<p>We're very excited to have such a large and enthusiastic group of students for our first course in Bulawayo.  We want all of you to learn as much as you can from here.  Welcome to CS 7.
